super()
- used to access/call parent class members(variables and methods)
- used with method overriding
- calling method with the same name from parent class. 
- this() call - call constructor from another overloaded constructor in the same class. must be used only in a constructor and must be the first statement. used with constructor chaining or when one constructor calls another constructor



this -
- used to call current class members (variables and methods). Required when there is aparameter with the same name as instance variable(field)
- used with constructors and setters. optionally used in getters



can use both of these anywhere in class except static areas (static block or static method). else will lead to compile-time errors
